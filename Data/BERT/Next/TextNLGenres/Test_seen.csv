S:: Can you recommend something purely comical?  R:: The actions scenes are a majority of the movie, but it has nice graphics. Do you like mythology? I would rate this movie an 8 out of 10.  S:: Nope, not enough to seek it. I like to be scared and to laugh at movies.  R:: Step Brothers (Comedy) is a seriously hilarious. it is extremely funny!  S:: I seen part of Step Brothers (Comedy). It seemed like an alright movie.  R:: Will Ferrell and Mark Walburgh really compliment each other. I laughed out loud throughout the whole movie. I don't think you will regret watching it all the way through.  S:: You really like the movies you suggest. Any other Will Ferrell movies you can suggest?  R:: Yes, otherwise I would be wasting your time.  S:: True.  R:: The Other Guys (Action Comedy Crime) is also worth checking out. That is actually the movie with Mark.  S:: What's that about?  R:: It is about two cops.  Will's character used to be a pimp. Many good laughs to be had. I hope you check them out. Elf (Comedy Family Fantasy Romance) is good for Christmas time, but it is a bit corny. The new Jumanji (Action Adventure Comedy Fantasy) is way better than I thought.  S:: I'm not interested in The Other Guys (Action Comedy Crime). But have you seen Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (Comedy Sport)?  R:: Jack Black and the Rock play the roles of the avatars in the game.  S:: It seemed funny from the previews years back.  R:: There is a new one that came out last year. It is much more funny than the original.  S:: I was still referring to Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (Comedy Sport) by the way.
